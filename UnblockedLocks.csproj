    <Description>Allows tasks (on separate threads) to acquire locks with a function call instead of creating a block of code. Locks are released when the task finishes. Detects and resolves deadlocks. Tasks are encouraged to organize their code into a starting segment that gets all locks required for the task, then verify the task is still valid in the current program state, then finally execute the task if still valid.
Designed for a usecase of servers with several client threads running simultaneously, and no clear heirarchy for locks. This allows developers to get locks in a convenient manner, while staying performant and safe in a multi-threaded application.</Description>
